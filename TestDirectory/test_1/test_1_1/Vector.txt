The Vector class implements a growable array of objects.
Like an array, it contains components 
that can be accessed using an integer index. 
However, the size of a Vector can grow or shrink 
as needed to accommodate adding and removing items 
after the Vector has been created.
Each vector tries to optimize storage management 
by maintaining a capacity and a capacityIncrement. 
The capacity is always at least as large as the vector size; 
it is usually larger because as components are added to the vector, 
the vector's storage increases in chunks the size of capacityIncrement. 
An application can increase the capacity of a vector 
before inserting a large number of components; 
this reduces the amount of incremental reallocation.
